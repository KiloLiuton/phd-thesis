\chapter{Mean field theory for small-world networks}
\label{chap:mf}

%The previous chapter focused mainly on simulation results for ring-lattices and small-world networks.

In this chapter we develop a mean field (MF) theory for the coupled oscillator dynamics with three discrete phase states in a system of
$N$ oscillators coupled in small-world networks as described by the Watts-Strogatz algorithm in section~\ref{smallworld}. We start by
re-stating the dynamic rules, and then proceed to define the mean field and the continuous limit.

An oscillator is described by its discrete phase state, which can be imagined as a clock hand which abruptly jumps from noon to 4pm,
then to 8pm and back to noon. Note that, as in a clock, the phase can only move forward, looping back on itself after three jumps.
These jumps occur randomly, but with a well defined average rate over time. When two oscillators interact, this average rate of
transition may change depending on the relative phase between the two units.

To describe the phase value and interactions, we adopt a convention: oscillators are arranged in a circle and numbered from 1 to $N$
(see figure~\ref{fig:ring-distance}). The superscripts then refer to the oscillator's position while the subscripts denote a phase
state from 1 to 3. Given a graph in which nodes represent phase oscillators labeled by $x$, the unit at position $x$ is described by
its phase value

\begin{align}
  \phi^x = 2\pi (j-1)/3 \\
  j \in \{1,2,3\} \notag
\end{align}

\noindent where $j\in\{1,2,3\}$ is the state of unit $x$. Since transitions can only occur in one direction, the stochastic rate of
transition from $j$ to $j+1$ is written just as $\gamma^x_j$, and its behavior is chosen to be of an exponential form:

\begin{equation}
  \gamma^x_j(t) = \omega^x\exp\left[ a\frac{n^x_{j+1}(t) - n^x_j(t)}{n^x} \right] \qquad x=1,\dots, N
  \label{rate}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\omega^x$ is its natural (uncoupled) frequency, $n^x_j(t)$ is the count of how many of its neighbors are in state $j$,
and $n^x$ is its total number of neighbors.

Let the probability of finding the unit at position $x$ in state $j$ at time $t$ be denoted by $P_j^x(t)$. Since there are only three
possible states we have the constraints $P_1^x(t)+P_2^x(t)+P_3^x(t)=1$ for all $x$ and $t$. The rate of change of the probabilities can
be written in terms of the transition rates $\gamma^x_j(t)$, giving us $2N$ equations of motion:

\begin{align}
  \ddt{p}^x_1(t) &= \gamma^x_3(t)(1 - P_1^x(t) - P_2^x(t)) - \gamma^x_1(t) P_1^x(t) & \notag\\
  \ddt{p}^x_2(t) &= \gamma^x_1(t)P_1^x(t) - \gamma^x_2(t) P_2^x(t) &x=1,\dots,N
  \label{eq:motion}
\end{align}

\noindent The first terms in the RHS of (\ref{eq:motion}) represent the fluxes of probability from oscillators in the previous state,
which can advance one phase state and increase the populations of oscillators in states 1 and 2 respectively. The second (negative)
terms represent the fluxes generated by the oscillator leaving the considered state, and thus reducing that states population. The
dynamics can take place on any arbitrary network that defines the coupling between oscillators. Previous work has explored hypercubic
lattices and complete graphs as well as regular ring graphs \cite{Wood06a,assis2011infinite,escaff2014arrays}.

Here we start by focusing on ring lattices, which will be the starting point for generating small-world networks. Ring lattices are
constructed by arranging $N$ oscillators in a circle, and then for each unit, adding $K$ clock-wise connections to the next $K$ units
in the circle, resulting in a circular shape with $NK$ total connections. The result of this process for $N=12$ and $K=2$ is shown in
figure~\ref{fig:ring} of chapter~\ref{chap:article}, as well as for $N=16$, $K=2$ in figure~\ref{fig:ring-distance} right.

To generate a small-world network from a ring graph we perform a \textit{rewiring} procedure. It visits each existing connection
exactly once, and with a probability $p$ exchanges the clockwise vertex of this connection for a randomly selected node in the network,
avoiding duplicate connections or self connections. This will be described in detail when deriving the MF approximation of small-world
networks.

\section{The local average field in the discrete case}

To define the local average field, we introduce a \textit{local order parameter} $\nu$ identified by the fractions in the exponent of
equation~(\ref{rate}) at a fixed time $t$. It is a measurement of the synchrony between oscillators which are coupled to the oscillator
at position $x$.

\begin{equation}
  \nu^x_j(t) \equiv \frac{n^x_j(t)}{n^x}
\end{equation}

\noindent the transition rates are now written as

\begin{align}
  \gamma^x_j(t) = \omega^x\exp\left[ a(\nu^x_{j+1}(t) - \nu^x_j(t)) \right]
  \label{eq:mfrate}
\end{align}

The quantity $\nu^x_j$ describes the fraction of oscillators connected to $x$ that are in state $j$, and thus also satisfies the
constraint $\nu^x_1+\nu^x_2+\nu^x_3=1$.

In the large-$N$ limit, we model the system behavior by replacing $\nu^x_j$ in equation~(\ref{eq:mfrate}) by its time dependent average
$\left< \nu^x_j(t) \right>$. When the rewiring probability $p=0$, it was shown that for the chosen form of the coupling the variance
$Var[\nu^x_j]$ is proportional to $1/N$ \cite{escaff2014arrays}. In the case of small-world networks ($0<p \leq 1$) it is unfeasible to
explicitly calculate the variance of the local order parameter, but in section~\ref{subsection:justifyapproximations} we develop
arguments that support the validity of this mean field approximation by performing partial calculations, and in
chapter~\ref{chap:simulation} we also perform numerical simulations for finite systems.

If fluctuations are small compared to the deterministic drift described by the MF approach the assumptions become better, but a
quantitative description may suffer from imprecision when compared to simulation results. With this in mind, the MF transition rates
become:

\begin{align}
  \gamma^x_{j,MF} = \omega^x \exp \left[ a \left( \left< \nu^x_{j+1}(t) \right> - \left< \nu^x_j(t) \right> \right) \right]
  \label{gammaMF}
\end{align}

For regular rings, the total number of neighbors of every site is fixed, $n^x= 2K$, but when dealing with rewired networks $n^x$
becomes a random variable which may assume different values in different realizations, making $\left<\nu^x_j(t)\right>$ trickier to
calculate.

The master equations in the MF are obtained by replacing the instantaneous transition rates in equation~ (\ref{eq:motion}) by their
mean field values.

\begin{align}
  \ddt{P_1^x}(t) &= \gamma^x_{3,MF} (1-P_1^x(t)-P_1^x(t)) - \gamma^x_{1,MF} P_1^x(t) \notag \\
  \ddt{P_2^x}(t) &= \gamma^x_{1,MF}  P_1^x(t) - \gamma^x_{2,MF} P_2^x(t)
  \label{eq:motionmf}
\end{align}

We are left with the task of calculating $\left<\nu^x_j(t)\right>$ in terms of the probabilities $P^x_j(t)$ such that \ref{eq:motionmf}
is an autonomous system. For that we define the dummy variable $D^{xx'}$, indicating the presence (or absence) of coupling between
nodes $x$ and $x'$ in a graph.

\subsection{Mean field value of the local order parameter}

Encoding the presence or absence of coupling by setting $D^{xx'}=1$ and $D^{xx'}=0$ respectively, we can write exact expressions for
$\nu^x_j(t)$ in the discrete case:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $D^{xx'}$ be defined as
  \begin{align}
  D^{xx'} = 
    \begin{cases}
    1 \qquad &\text{if the connection $x$,$x'$ exists}\\
    0 \qquad &\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  \item Let $x$ denote some position in the lattice for which we wish to know the local order parameter value.
  \item Let $j$ denote the state for which we wish to measure the order parameter for.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Then:

\begin{align}
  n^x_j(t) &= \sum\limits_{x'=1}^ND^{xx'}\delta(j,j'(t)) \notag\\[8pt]
  n^x &= \sum\limits_{x'=1}^ND^{xx'}
\end{align}

\noindent where $j'$ is the state of the oscillator at position $x'$ at time $t$ and $\delta(j,j'(t))$ is the usual Kronecker delta
defined by $\delta(j,j')=1$ if $ j=j'$ and $0$ else. The average values then become

\begin{align}
  \left< \nu^x_j(t) \right> &= \sum_{x'} \left< \frac{D^{xx'}\delta(j,j'(t))}{\sum_{x''}D^{xx''}}
  \right> \notag \\[8pt]
  \left< \nu^x_j(t) \right> &= \sum_{x'} \left< \frac{D^{xx'}}{\sum_{x''}D^{xx''}}\right>\left<\delta(j,j'(t)) \right>
  \label{eq:numf}
\end{align}

\noindent Equation~(\ref{eq:numf}) introduces the major MF approximation, where $\delta(j,j'(t))$ is independent from $D^{xx'}$,
implying the dynamics are described by the ``average connectivity'' between oscillators on the graph. This approximation becomes more
accurate when the probability of rewiring $p$ approaches zero, which is true for a large number of networks in the small-world regime,
as seen in figure~\ref{fig:small-world} of chapter~\ref{chap:article}. When $p=0$ we can restrict the summation over connected sites,
from $(x-K)$ to $(x+K)$, recovering the MF proposed by Escaff \textit{et al.}~\cite{escaff2014arrays} for regular rings.

The average $\left< \delta(j,j'(t)) \right>$ is identified with the probability of finding site $x'$ in state $j$ at time $t$: $\left<
\delta(j,j'(t)) \right> \equiv P_j^{x'}(t)$, and we are left with the task of calculating $\left< D^{xx'}/\sum D^{xx'} \right>$. In
order to unpack this expression we need a detailed description of the rewiring algorithm, which ultimately dictates the connectivity of
the final graph.

\begin{figure}
  \centering

  \caption{\label{fig:ring-distance}

    between units.\\

  }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Rewiring algorithm}

Here we give a detailed description of the rewiring algorithm in order to justify our expressions for the probability of existence of
connections in the final graph, which dictate the dynamics. It considers each connection in the starting graph exactly once, and with
probability $p$ it tries to swap one of its vertices for another randomly selected node in the network, avoiding double connections of
self connections. Detailed instructions on how it was implemented are written in pseudo-code.

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
Given a ring lattice with N nodes and range K do:
for z from 1 to K:
  for x from 1 to N:
    with probability p do:
      sample a uniform integer r from 1 to N
      if ( r == x ) or ( connection (x, r) already exists ):
        do nothing
      else:
        remove the connection (x, x+z)
        add the connection (x, r)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

To determine the probability that the connection $(x, x')$ exists in the rewired graph, we introduce the notion of distance between
nodes $x$ and $x'$. Let this be denoted by $d_{xx'}$, and the distance defined in the one-dimensional chain as illustrated in
figure~\ref{fig:ring-distance}. Due to the periodic condition $x \mapsto x+N$ on the boundaries, no distance can be greater than $N/2$,
and thus $d_{xx'}$ is formally defined as:

\begin{align}
  d_{xx'} =
  \begin{cases}
    |x-x'| \quad &\text{if $|x-x'|\leq N/2$} \\
    N-|x-x'| \quad &\text{if $|x-x'| > N/2$}
  \end{cases}
  \label{dist}
\end{align}

To calculate the average values $\left< D^{xx'} \right>$ we consider two cases: $d_{xx'} \leq K$, the \textbf{close case}, and $d_{xx'}
> K$, the \textbf{far case}. The reasoning is that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If the initial distance between two nodes is less than or equal to $K$, then by construction of the ring graph they start out
    connected. The condition that this connection exists in the final graph is that it was never removed in the first place, or it
    could have been removed and then subsequently reformed.

  \item On the other hand, sites with $d_{xx'}>K$ start out disconnected, and thus a connection $(x,x')$ can only result from one of
    its vertices being rewired that way.
\end{itemize}

With a little thought regarding the rewiring procedure, one will agree that if it produces any connection, it is guaranteed to be
present in the result. Conversely, if it fails to break an initial connection, that connection is also guaranteed to exist in the final
graph.

\subsection*{Far case}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fig/rewire_contributions.png}
  \caption{The presence of the connection $(x,x')$, in {\color{blue}\textbf{blue}}, in a small-world network generated from the
    Watts-Strogatz algorithm can only be the result of the rewiring of a {\color{red}\textbf{red}} connection. On the left side, the
    \textbf{far} case, $2K$ connections may contribute to the formation of $(x,x')$. On the \textbf{near} case (right side), the
    original connection may either be left untouched or, in case it is initially broken, it might be wired again by any of the
  remaining $2(K-d_{xx'})+1$ solid {\color{red} red} connections.}
  \label{fig:rewire_contributions}
\end{figure}

Here we derive the probability of existence of a connection between $x$ and $x'$ when $d_{xx'}>K$. Since the algorithm tries to swap
(with probability $p$) the clockwise node of an initial connection, the only connections that could possibly have broken to form
$(x,x')$ are the $K$ clockwise neighbors of $x$, and the $K$ clockwise neighbors of $x'$, as illustrated in the left panel of
figure~\ref{fig:rewire_contributions}. If any of these $2K$ events take place, $(x,x')$ is guaranteed to exist. Thus, $P(D^{xx'}=1)$ is
the probability that at least one forming event took place, which is just the complement of the probability that \textit{no} such event
took place.

\begin{align}
  P(D^{xx'}=1) = 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{p}{N} \right)^{2K} \qquad \text{for} \quad d_{xx'} > K
  \label{eq:probfar}
\end{align}

In equation~(\ref{eq:probfar}), the probability that a connection rewires to $(x,x')$ is the probability that it breaks times the
probability of selecting the other vertex, which is just $p/N$. Therefore, the probability that a connection \textit{does not} rewire
to $(x,x')$ is the complement $1-p/N$. The probability that \textit{none} of the $2K$ connections generate $(x,x')$ is then
$(1-p/N)^{2K}$, and the probability that at least one of them \textit{does} generate it is the complement again.

\subsection*{Near case}

The near case is given by $d_{xx'}\leq K$. When considering the probability of existence for such shorter range connections, things get
more complicated because the exact solutions depend on the choice of the starting point of the rewiring procedure. Consider the case
shown in figure~\ref{fig:order_dependence} for interaction range $K=1$.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{fig/order_dependence.png}
  \caption{Rewiring of connection C2 may or may not contribute to the probability of existence of connection C1. If the rewiring
  process starts at A, then C2 may be rewired into C1 if it was initially broken. On the other hand, if the starting point is B,
  connection C2 can never be rewired to C1 because the later will always be present at the time of rewiring C2.}

  \label{fig:order_dependence}
\end{figure}

If the rewiring process starts at point A, then rewiring of connection C2 contributes to the probability that C1 is present in the
final graph. On the other hand, if the rewiring starts at point B, then C2 does not contribute to the probability of existence of C1.
Therefore C1 has a higher probability of existing for a rewiring that started at A as opposed to one that started at B. Luckily for our
purposes the order dependence only happens for the first connection of length $d_{xx'}$ (dashed {\color{red}red} line on right of
figure~\ref{fig:rewire_contributions}), since for subsequent connections (solid {\color{red}red} lines on same figure) the pair
$(x,x')$ will already have been considered by the algorithm, and any forming event from that point guarantees the existence of the
connection $(x,x')$.

To avoid order dependence, we will assume the problematic event contributes the same amount as subsequent events to the probability of
existence of the considered connection. Thus, all $2K-2d_{xx'}+1$ events contribute equally to $P(D^{xx'}=1)$, which is written as:

\begin{align}
  P(D^{xx'}=1) = 1 - p\left(1-\frac{2K}{N}\right)\left(1-\frac{p}{N}\right)^{2K - 2d_{xx'} + 1} \qquad \text{for} \quad d_{xx'} \leq K
  \label{eq:probnear}
\end{align}

\noindent As before, the expression is obtained by taking the complement of the probability that no event forms the connection
$(x,x')$: the probability that the original connection is broken is $p(1-2K/N)$ ($p$ times the probability of selecting a site which
does not already have a connection with $x$). This is another approximation since the number of connections involving site $x$ may
change during the rewiring procedure, but because the later conserves the total number of connections it is at least justifiable for
now (we later confirm it numerically). The term $(1-p/N)^{2K-2d_{xx'}+1}$ accounts for the probabilities that no forming event occurs
with the potential connections marked in {\color{red}red} on the right side of figure~\ref{fig:rewire_contributions}.

\subsection{The discrete average field}
\label{subsection:justifyapproximations}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/rewire_mc.png}
  \caption{Comparison between expressions for the probability of existence of connections as functions of rewiring probability $p$.
    Dots are obtained from Monte Carlo sampling of small-world networks produced by the Watts-Strogatz algorithm, solid red lines are
    equations (\ref{eq:probfar}) (top) and (\ref{eq:probnear}) (bottom). \\ System size $N=1000$ with 50 realizations each. Note that
    when $p\to 0$ initially disconnected oscillators remain uncoupled while oscillators at distances $d^{xx'}\leq K$ remain coupled.}

  \label{fig:rewire_mc}
\end{figure}

To check that the probabilities $P(D^{xx'})$ are valid, we performed Monte Carlo sampling of the small-world networks and plotted the
relative frequencies obtained against the probabilities given by equations~(\ref{eq:probfar}) and (\ref{eq:probnear}). The results are
shown for various values of $p$ and $\alpha \equiv K/N$ in figure~\ref{fig:rewire_mc}, where good agreement is observed for all values
of $p$ and interaction range $K$ with fixed $N=1000$.

Note that since $D^{xx'}$ are binary variables with values 1 and 0 the probabilities $P(D^{xx'}=1)$ are given by the average
$\left<D^{xx'}\right>$, resulting in

\begin{equation}
  \left<D^{xx'}\right> =
  \begin{cases}
    1-\left( 1 - \frac{p}{N} \right)^{2\alpha N} \quad &\text{if} \quad d_{xx'}>K \\
    1-p\left( 1 - 2\alpha \right)\left( 1 - \frac{p}{N} \right)^{2(\alpha-\alpha')N+1} \quad &\text{if} \quad d_{xx'}\leq K\\
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:probconnection}
\end{equation}

\noindent where we have used the definitions $\alpha \equiv K/N$ and $\alpha' \equiv d^{xx'}/N$, which are assumed to be constant as
$N$ scales with proportional $K$ and $d^{xx'}$. When $N$ is large, we use the property

\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{N\to \infty}\left( 1 - \frac{p}{N} \right)^{2\alpha N + C} = e^{-2\alpha p}
\end{equation*}

\noindent to simplify the expression to

\begin{equation}
  \left<D^{xx'}\right> =
  \begin{cases}
    1-e^{-2\alpha p} \quad &\text{if} \quad d_{xx'}>K \\
    1-p\left( 1 - 2\alpha \right)e^{-2(\alpha-\alpha')p} \quad &\text{if} \quad d_{xx'}\leq K\\
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:probconnectionexp}
\end{equation}

Going back to equation~(\ref{eq:numf}), we wish to calculate the quantity $\left< \frac{D^{xx'}}{\sum D^{xx'}} \right>$. To do this, we
argue that $\var{\sum D^{xx'}}$ is small, and thus $\sum D^{xx'} \simeq \left< \sum D^{xx'} \right>$ which is a constant, allowing us
to replace the average of the quotient by the quotient of the averages, leading to

\begin{equation}
    \left< \frac{D^{xx'}}{\sum_{x'}D^{xx'}} \right> \simeq \frac{\left< D^{xx'} \right>}{\sum_{x'}\left< D^{xx'} \right>}
    \label{eq:avgquotient}
\end{equation}

\noindent For small-world networks, the parameter $p$ tends to be small\cite{rodrigues2020synchronization}, as seen from
figure~\ref{fig:small-world}. Thus, we take equation~(\ref{eq:probconnectionexp}) and expand the exponential terms in powers of $p$
around $p=0$. Keeping up to first order in $p$ results in:

\begin{align}
  \sum_{x'=1}^N \left< D^{xx'} \right> = &
  \sum_{d_{xx'}>K} 2\alpha p \notag \\
  + &
  \sum_{d_{xx'}\leq K} \left( 1 - p + 2\alpha p \right),
\end{align}

Since the terms are now independent of $x'$, and noting that there are $2K=2\alpha N$ terms with distance $d^{xx'}\leq K$ and
$N-2K=N(1-2\alpha)$ terms with distance $d^{xx'}>K$, we obtain:

\begin{align}
  \sum_{x'=1}^N \left< D^{xx'} \right> &\simeq N(1-2\alpha)2\alpha p + 2\alpha N\left( 1 - p + 2\alpha p \right) \notag\\
  &= \cancel{2\alpha Np} - \bcancel{4\alpha^2Np} + 2\alpha N - \cancel{2\alpha Np} + \bcancel{4\alpha^2Np}
\end{align}

\noindent or,

\begin{align}
  \sum_{x'=1}^N \left< D^{xx'} \right> &\simeq 2K
\end{align}

This result is consistent with the previous statement that the average
number of neighbors remains unchanged after the rewiring procedure, and also recovers previous results\cite{escaff2014arrays} for the
case $p=0$.

We now focus briefly on calculating $\var{\sum D^{xx'}}$. The numerical analysis depicted in figure~\ref{fig:rewire_mc} shows that
regarding the presence of connections in the final graph as independent events is a very good approximation. Thus, we can distribute
the variance function inside the summation and ignore the covariance term, leading to:

\begin{equation}
  \var{\sum_{x'}D^{xx'}} = \sum_{x'} \var{D^{xx'}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\var{D^{xx'}} = \left< \left( D^{xx'} \right)^2 \right> - \left< D^{xx'} \right>^2$, but since $D^{xx'}$ are indicator
variables with outcomes 0 or 1, we have that $\left< \left( D^{xx'} \right)^2 \right> = \left< D^{xx'} \right>$ and therefore:

\begin{equation}
  \var{D^{xx'}} = \left< D^{xx'} \right> - \left< D^{xx'} \right>^2
\end{equation}

By making use of equation~(\ref{eq:probconnectionexp}) and once more and expanding the exponentials around $p=0$ gives:

\begin{equation}
  \var{D^{xx'}} =
  \begin{cases}
    2\alpha p + \mathcal{O}(p^2) & \text{if $d^{xx'} > K$} \\
    \left( 1-2\alpha \right)p + \mathcal{O}(p^2) & \text{if $d^{xx'} \leq K$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent which finally gives us the result

\begin{equation*}
  \sum\limits_{x'=1}^N\var{D^{xx'}} \simeq \sum_{d^{xx'} > K} 2\alpha p + \sum_{d^{xx'} \leq K} \left( 1-2\alpha \right)p
\end{equation*}

\noindent or,

\begin{equation}
  \var{\sum_{x'}D^{xx'}} = \left(1-2\alpha\right)4\alpha pN + \mathcal{O}(p^2)N
\end{equation}

The resulting variance is proportional to $Np$, and thus for large $N$ it grows without bound. Nonetheless, it may be regarded as
sufficiently small when compared to other system properties which are independent of $p$ and, with these last considerations, we
proceed to write the expression for the average of the local order parameter as:

\begin{equation}
  \left< \nu^x_j(t) \right> = \frac{1}{2K} \sum_{x'}\left< D^{xx'} \right> P^{x'}_j(t)
  \label{eq:numffirstorder}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $P^{x'}_j(t) \equiv \left< \delta(j,j'(t)) \right>$ is the probability that the state $j'$ of the oscillator at
position $x'$ is equal to $j$ at time $t$.  Using equation~(\ref{eq:probconnectionexp}) and substituting into (\ref{eq:numffirstorder})
results in the MF expression:

\begin{equation}
  \left< \upsilon_j^x(t) \right> = \underbrace{\frac{p}{N}\sum_{x'=1}^N P_j^{x'}(t)}_{\text{Global}}
  \quad + \quad \underbrace{\frac{1-p}{2K}\sum_{x'=x-K}^{x+K} P_j^{x'}(t)}_{\text{Local}}
  \label{eq:upsilonp}
\end{equation}

\noindent where we have completed the global sum by adding and subtracting the missing gap $x'-K$ and $x'+K$.

We see that the effect of the rewiring process is to induce a global coupling component, while the coupling inside the initial range
$2K$ is reduced by a factor $(1-p)$. In the limit of $p\to 0$, equation~(\ref{eq:upsilonp}) recovers the MF previously derived by
Escaff \textit{et al.} for regular ring lattices\cite{escaff2014arrays}. We also note that the limit $p\to 1$ yields an intuitive
result, even if only qualitatively so: when the network is fully random ($p=1$), the local term vanishes, resulting exclusively in a
global term. This is expected from our early assumption that the dynamics are governed by the average connectivity, since for random
networks every connection has the same average connectivity value.

\section{Continuous limit}

In the previous section the discrete MF was derived by taking the limit $N\to\infty$ while keeping the ratio $\alpha\equiv K/N$ fixed.
We now proceed to take the continuous limit of (\ref{eq:upsilonp}) by mapping the oscillators indexes from 1 to $N$ to the semi-open
interval $[0,1)$ in the reals. The indexes $x,x' \in \{1,...,N\}$ become position coordinates $x,x'\in [0,1)$ and therefore $\nu^x_j(t)
\to \nu_j(x,t)$ where $j$ still represents the state of the unit at $x$ with $j\in\{1,2,3\}$. Analogously, the expression for the
probability of finding the oscillator at $x$ in state $j$ is now $P_j(x,t)$. The periodic conditions for any function of position $x$
becomes $f(x)=f(x+1)$. As for the sums we now have

\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{N}\sum_{x'=1}^N &\to \int_{0}^{1} dx' \notag\\
  \frac{1}{2K}\sum_{x'=-K}^K &\to \frac{1}{2\alpha}\int_{-\alpha}^{\alpha} dx'
\end{align}

\noindent which leads us to the continuous expression for $\nu_j(x,t)$:

\begin{align}
  \nu_j(x,t) = p \int_0^1 P_j(x',t)dx' + \frac{1-p}{2\alpha}\int_{x-\alpha}^{x+\alpha} P_j(x',t)dx'.
  \label{eq:numfcontinuous}
\end{align}

\noindent The transition rate from state $j$ to $j+1$ for an oscillator at position $x$ in the continuous MF limit is then given by
rewriting equation~(\ref{eq:mfrate}) with the notation $\gamma^x_j(t) \to \gamma_j(x,t)$ and using (\ref{eq:numfcontinuous}) in place
of $\nu^x_j$:

\begin{align}
  \gamma_j(x,t) = \omega(x) \exp\left\{ a\left[ \nu_{j+1}(x,t) - \nu_j(x,t) \right] \right\}
  \label{eq:ratecontinuous}
\end{align}

\noindent where $\omega(x)$ is the uncoupled frequency of the oscillator at $x$, sampled from some unimodal symmetric distribution $g$.

The set of $2N$ master equations (\ref{eq:motion}) that describe the time evolution of probabilities reduce to just 2 equations for the
now spatially distributed probability $P_j(x,t)$. Again we have the condition $P_1(x,t) + P_2(x,t) + P_3(x,t)=1$ so that we only need
two equations to describe the probabilities of all three states. The master equation for state $j$ is then written as

\begin{align}
  \ddt{P_j}(x,t) &= \gamma_{j-1}(x,t)P_{j-1}(x,t) - \gamma_j(x,t)P_j(x,t) & x\in[0,1)
  \label{eq:motioncontinuous}
\end{align}

The solutions of equations~(\ref{eq:motioncontinuous}) thus describe the predicted behaviors of sufficiently large populations of
oscillators, and can be compared to direct simulations of the dynamics.

\section{Solutions for the continuous mean field}

The system described by equations~(\ref{eq:ratecontinuous})~and~(\ref{eq:motioncontinuous}) is the MF approximation for rewired ring
lattices. One solution to this system is $P_1(x,t)=P_2(x,t)=1/3$, called the \textit{quiescent} solution. To see this, note that from
equation~(\ref{eq:numfcontinuous}) we have $\nu_1(x,t) = \nu_2(x,t)$ when the probabilities are the same, and therefore $\gamma_1(x,t)
= \gamma_2(x,t) = \gamma_3(x,t)=\omega(x)$ from equation~(\ref{eq:ratecontinuous}). The \textit{quiescent} solution is stable when the
coupling strength $a$ is below some critical value $a_c$ that depends on the couplings and whose lowest value is attained for the
complete graph, with $a_c=1.5$. The threshold $a_c$ marks a Hopf bifurcation\footnotemark type transition for graphs that support
global oscillations\cite{Wood06a}\cite{rodrigues2020synchronization}\cite{Wood06b}\cite{Wood07b}. When the coupling $a$ is larger than
the critical value $a_c$ the \textit{quiescent} solution becomes unstable and self-organization takes place, usually in the form of
global synchronization. This does not necessarily mean global oscillations are stable in the mathematical sense. Analysis for the
globally synchronized phases has been notoriously difficult for oscillator models in general.

\footnotetext{A Hopf bifurcation occurs when a periodic solution arises around an equilibrium point as some parameter varies. Here, the
oscillations arise around the \textit{quiescent} solution as $a$ increases beyond $a_c$.}

In chapter~\ref{chap:simulation} we explore simulations on small-world networks with strong coupling that do not always lead to global
oscillations. Depending on initial conditions and the intrinsic noise, the system may converge to a travelling wave solution,
displaying only local synchronization. Following a similar analysis by Escaff et al.\cite{escaff2014arrays}, we investigate such a wave
solution by perturbing the \textit{quiescent} state with a waveform and then checking what happens to the time evolution of the
amplitude of said perturbation, which we modulate by some arbitrary parameter $\epsilon_j$:

\begin{align}
  P_j(x,t) = 1/3 + \epsilon_j e^{ikx + \lambda t}
  \label{eq:solperturb}
\end{align}

\noindent where $i=\sqrt{-1}$, $k\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$. The periodic condition $P_j(0,t) = P_j(1,t)$ implies that
$k=2m\pi$ for an integer $m$. Assuming the perturbed solution is still a solution to the master equations~(\ref{eq:motioncontinuous}),
the goal is to identify whether there are any conditions on the model parameters that allow for $\operatorname{Re}[\lambda]>0$, since
in this case the amplitude of the waveform increases with time. Thus, for wave solutions we have

\begin{align}
  \ddt{P}_j(x,t) &= \lambda\epsilon_j e^{ikx + \lambda t}
  \label{eq:dpperturb}
\end{align}

\noindent and for $\nu_j(x,t)$ (equation~(\ref{eq:numfcontinuous})) the global component vanishes, due to the periodic condition
$k=2\pi m$, and we get:

\begin{align}
  \nu_j(x,t) &= \frac{p}{3} + p\epsilon_je^{\lambda t}\cancelto{0}{\int_0^1 e^{ikx'}dx'} +
  \frac{1-p}{3} + \frac{1-p}{2\alpha} \epsilon_je^{\lambda t}\int_{x-\alpha}^{x+\alpha}e^{ikx'}dx' \notag\\[14pt]
  \nu_j(x,t) &= \frac{1}{3} + (1-p)\frac{\sin k\alpha}{k\alpha}\epsilon_je^{ikx+\lambda t}
  \label{eq:nuperturb}
\end{align}

\noindent equation~(\ref{eq:nuperturb}) can now be substituted in (\ref{eq:ratecontinuous}) to obtain the transition rate for the wave
solution:

\begin{align}
  \gamma_j(x,t) &= \omega(x)\exp\left[ a(1-p)\frac{\sin k\alpha}{k\alpha}(\epsilon_{j+1}-\epsilon_j)e^{ikx+\lambda t} \right]
  \label{eq:rateperturb}
\end{align}

Substituting equations~(\ref{eq:solperturb}),(\ref{eq:dpperturb}) and (\ref{eq:rateperturb}) into the master
equations~(\ref{eq:motioncontinuous}) yields the conditions under which the wave solution may exist. We introduce here the notations
$W\equiv ikx + \lambda t$ and $\hat{a}\equiv a(1-p)\frac{\sin k\alpha}{k\alpha}$ for brevity:

\begin{align}
  \lambda \epsilon_je^W = \omega(x)e^{\hat{a}(\epsilon_j-\epsilon_{j-1})e^W}\left(1/3+\epsilon_{j-1}e^W\right)
  - \omega(x)e^{\hat{a}(\epsilon_{j+1}-\epsilon_j)e^W}\left(1/3+\epsilon_je^W\right) \notag
\end{align}

\noindent This can be reduced by using the approximation $e^x \approx 1 + x$, $x\approx 0$ in the small $\epsilon_j$ regime. Setting
all the remaining terms in $\epsilon_j$, of order 2 or higher, to zero yields:

\begin{align}
  \lambda \epsilon_j\cancel{e^W} &= \omega(x)\left(1+\hat{a}(\epsilon_j-\epsilon_{j-1})e^W\right)\left(1/3+\epsilon_{j-1}e^W\right)
  - \omega(x)\left(1+\hat{a}(\epsilon_{j+1}-\epsilon_j)e^W\right)\left(1/3+\epsilon_je^W\right) \notag \\
  &= \omega(x)\left( \epsilon_{j-1} - \epsilon_j + \frac{\hat{a}}{3}\left( 2\epsilon_j - \epsilon_{j-1} - \epsilon_{j+1} \right) \right)\cancel{e^W} \notag
\end{align}

\noindent but the condition $P_{j-1}(x,t)+P_j(x,t)+P_{j+1}(x,t)=1$ implies $\epsilon_{j-1}=-\epsilon_j-\epsilon_{j+1}$ and thus:

\begin{align}
  \lambda = \omega(x)\left( \hat{a}-2 - \frac{\epsilon_{j+1}}{\epsilon_j} \right)
  \label{eq:lambdaj}
\end{align}

Finally, setting $j=1$ and then $j=2$ gives us two independent equations which can be used to eliminate the ratio
$\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2$ from equation~(\ref{eq:lambdaj}) and solve for $\lambda$:

\begin{align}
  \lambda &= \omega(x)\left( \hat{a} - 2 - \frac{\epsilon_2}{\epsilon_1} \right) \notag \\
  \lambda &= \omega(x)\left( \hat{a} - 2 + 1 + \frac{\epsilon_1}{\epsilon_2} \right) \notag \\
  &\Downarrow \notag \\
  \lambda &= \omega(x)\left( \hat{a} - \frac{3}{2} \pm \frac{1}{2}i\sqrt{3} \right)
  \label{eq:lambdacontinuous}
\end{align}

Equation (\ref{eq:lambdacontinuous}) expresses the dispersion relation $\lambda(k,x)$, and thus the frequency of the travelling wave
depends on position. If the natural frequencies were to form some macroscopic pattern throughout $x$, this analysis would predict local
changes to the wave frequency as it travels around the system. But because $\omega \sim g$ for some symmetrical unimodal distribution
$g$, in the continuous limit the speed-ups and slow-downs cancel out and the result is dominated by the average value of $g$ denoted by
$\bar{g}$. This can be seen from the fact that, for any positive value $\delta x$ we have:

\begin{align}
  \int_x^{x+\delta x} \omega(x')dx' &= \bar{g} \notag\\
  & \Downarrow \notag\\
  \int_x^{x+\delta x} \lambda(k,x')dx' &= \bar{g} \left( \hat{a} - \frac{3}{2} \pm \frac{1}{2}i\sqrt{3} \right)
\end{align}

And therefore, the local value of $\lambda$ for an arbitrarily small neighborhood around $x$, for any $x$, is given by the average
value $\bar{g}$. The perturbed solutions for sufficiently small values of $\epsilon_j$ are then written as

\begin{align}
  P_j(x,t) = \frac{1}{3} + \epsilon_j e^{\left( \hat{a} - \frac{3}{2} \right)\bar{g}t} e^{i\left(kx + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\bar{g}t\right)}
\end{align}

\noindent where we have factored out $\operatorname{Re}(\lambda)$ to explicitly show the time dependence of the amplitude of the
waveform. If this quantity is positive the wave amplitude grows without boundaries until higher order terms start dominating and
possibly leading to saturation and stable waves. If $\operatorname{Re}(\lambda)$ is negative than the perturbation will die out and the
quiescent steady state will be reached. The fact that the dynamics only allow for one directional transitions (namely from $j$ to $j+1$
cycling back to 1 when $j=3$) means $\bar{g}>0$ always, and therefore $\operatorname{Re}(\lambda)>0$ implies $\hat{a} > 3/2$ which is:

\begin{align}
  a(1-p)\frac{\sin(2\pi m\alpha)}{2\pi m\alpha} > \frac{3}{2}
  \label{eq:lambdapos}
\end{align}

\noindent where $m$ is an integer and $\alpha$ is the interaction range expressed as a fraction of system size. The derivation of
equation~(\ref{eq:nuperturb}) assumes $m\neq 0$ in order for the left integral to vanish, and thus the globally synchronized steady
state ($m=0$) is not described by equation~(\ref{eq:lambdapos}). For a given value of $\alpha$ and some wave number $m$, the critical
value for the coupling is given by setting an equality in equation~(\ref{eq:lambdapos}):

\begin{align}
  a_c = \frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{(1-p)}\frac{(2\pi m\alpha)}{\sin(2\pi m\alpha)}
\end{align}

Thus, the critical value is a function of $p$, $\alpha$, and the wave number $m$. If we fix $p$ and $\alpha$, which are continuous
quantities, we can get a sequence of critical values by varying the wave number $m$. Table~\ref{table:criticalvalues} shows a few such
sequences for different choices of the connectivity range $\alpha$ and a rewiring probability of $p=0$. Each row is sorted by
decreasing critical values.

\end{figure}

\noindent We see that if the coupling strength is decreased (increased) from 0 to more negative (positive) values, wave numbers become
stable one by one. For example, if $\alpha=0.2$ in table~\ref{table:criticalvalues} and we decrease the coupling starting from 0, the
first stable wave number is $m=4$ at the critical value of $a_c=-7.93$. These are the results derived in the work of Escaff et
al.\cite{escaff2014arrays} for the case of $p=0$. In our extension to small-world networks, the effect of increasing $p$ is to make the
critical sequence increase or decrease more sharply, as illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:criticalsequences}. A noteworthy aspect of these
sequences of critical values is that, for negative coupling, the system spontaneously self-organize to a wave solution when the first
negative critical value is reached. For positive coupling, the first stable solution is the globally synchronized one, with $m=0$ and
critical value of $a_c=1.5$\cite{Wood06a,Wood06b,assis2011infinite,rodrigues2020synchronization}. Therefore, no wave solution will
spontaneously form even when increasing the coupling to arbitrarily large values, since global synchrony is vastly more probable when
the system is the quiescent initial state\cite{rodrigues2020synchronization}. For real systems with finite size, we might expect that
fluctuations can indeed induce transitions between the different wave numbers for positive values of the coupling parameter, which is
indeed verified in simulations in chapter \ref{chap:simulation}.

\section{Conclusions} In this chapter we have derived a MF approximation for discrete coupled oscillators with natural frequency
distribution $\omega\sim g$ on small-world networks generated by introducing coupling disorder into the regular ring networks. To
obtain analytical results, and derive analogous expressions to previous work, we have restricted these to the regime of small disorder
($p$). It is also implicitly assumed that the behavior of a sufficiently large network will be approximated by the average behavior
over different networks, since the building process for the small-world networks considered here is stochastic. For real finite
systems, it is possible that some realization of a small-world network would not produce these macroscopic behaviors since fluctuations
become more dominant as system size is decreased. Nonetheless, the theory predicts some properties that can be tested through
simulation, such as the failure to achieve global synchrony even for large positive couplings depending on initial conditions and
fluctuations, and the change in speed with which these waves travel if there are macroscopic patterns in the spatial distribution of
the natural frequencies of the constituent phase oscillators.
